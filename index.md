## Typical workflow of many research projects

<br>
<br>
First have an idea

e.g. Does sunshine influence happiness?

<br>
<br>

![](assets/img/idea.png)



---

## 1. Prepare data (Excel)

<center>![](assets/img/excel.png)</center>

---

## 2. Do some analysis (R)

![](assets/img/rstudio.png)


---

## 3. Write a report/paper (Word)


![](assets/img/word.png)

All results (figures, tables) **manually** imported to Word

---

## This workflow is broken

<br>

1. Collect and manage data (**EXCEL**)

2. Analysis (**R**)

3. Write up (**WORD**)

## Problems brought by the broken workflow



*** =left

*** =right

> - What analysis is behind this figure? Did you account for [...] in the analysis?

> - What dataset was used (e.g. final vs preliminary dataset)?

> - Oops, there is an error in the data. Can you repeat the analysis? And update figures/tables in Word!


> - As a coauthor/reader, I'd like to see the whole research process (how you arrived to that conclusion), rather than cooked manuscript with inserted tables/figures.


---

## Rmarkdown allows us to fix the disconnect

Integrating 

1. Data management

2. Data analysis

3. Writing up results

in a single dynamic document

<br>
<br>

> **REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH!**

## Let's make our sunshine-happiness research reproducible

<br>

- Before starting any project read this: 
[Designing projects at Nice R Code](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/)

![](assets/img/projects.png)

<br>
- Now see myproject.Rmd


--- &twocol

## With PANDOC, conversion to PDF or Word is straightforward

---

### If spotting error in the data, or using different dataset...

make changes in Rmarkdown and report will update automatically


--- &twocol  

## So... main advantages

*** =left

![](assets/img/report.png)


*** =right

- Data management fully documented (no more manual changes in Excel!)

- Analysis fully documented

- Automated reports

- Lots of customisation options!


---

## Convert your R scripts to Rmd, html, word, pdf...

- with [one click in RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/markdown_notebooks)

![](assets/img/notebook.png)


- using knitr::spin or knitr::stitch [e.g. stitch("Rscript2convert.R")]

## Ten simple rules for Reproducible Research

> 1. For every result, keep track of how it was produced

> 2. Avoid manual data manipulation steps

> 3. Archive the exact versions of all external programs used

> 4. Version control all custom scripts

> 5. Record all intermediate results, when possible in standardized formats


---

## Ten simple rules for Reproducible Research

> 6. For analyses that include randomness, note underlying random seeds

> 7. Always store raw data behind plots

> 8. Generate hierarchical analysis output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected

> 9.  Connect textual statements to underlying results

> 10. Provide public access to scripts, runs, and results
